Product builder with a security mindset, currently progressing through Network+ and Security+ certification tracks and hands-on lab practice. I’m developing Fieldsy.io as a real-world platform project, alongside hardware and systems prototypes (Raspberry Pi and Arduino) to expand practical engineering experience.
